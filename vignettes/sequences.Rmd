# Introduction

The dummy `sequences` package is used to illustrate the *Advanced R
programming and package development*.  It describes classes and
methods to manipulate generic and biological sequences.  If you are
interested in real sequence manipulation in R, have a look at
[Biostrings](http://www.bioconductor.org/help/bioc-views/release/bioc/html/Biostrings.html),
[seqinr](http://seqinr.r-forge.r-project.org/) or
[ape](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ape/index.html), and
possibly others.

This package can be installed with

```{r, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("lgatto/sequences")
```


# Using `sequences`

Let's start by loading the package and read a fasta sequence that is
provided with the package.

```{r loadseq}
library("sequences")
fafile <- dir(system.file(package = "sequences", dir = "extdata"),
              full.name = TRUE,
              pattern = "fasta$")
fafile
myseq <- readFasta(fafile[1])
myseq
```

Printing the sequence displays it's sequence numbering
the lines.

```{r}
print(myseq)
```

This creates an instance of class \Sexpr{class(myseq)} that can be
transcribed with the \Rfunction{transcribe} method.

```{r}
transcribe(myseq)
```

```{r gccount, fig.cap = "Number of A, C, G and T bases in the `myseq` object.")
barplot(gccount(seq(myseq)))
```

# Background


This package is developed as part of the *Advanced R programming and
package development* (ARPD) course, taught by Laurent Gatto and Robert
Stojnic.  The course has originally been set up and run as an intense
1 day course in the Graduate School of Life Sciences of the University
of Cambridge.  Since March 2011, the course has been run on a regular
basis in the Bioinformatics Teaching Facilty in the Department of
Genetics, Cambridge.

In November 2011 and December 2012, 2 day courses were taught at the
EMBL in Heidelberg, at Wolfgang Huber's invitation.
